 The purpose of this article is to document the approach to the Bretl Research Group's visual-inertial odometry method. To develop this method we test using a segment of the Euroc dataset.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Coordinate Systems}

\subsection{Peformance Evaluation}
We evaluate performance using measure of the relative pose error (RPE) of the translational state estimate over 100 time intervals. Each interval will have at least 20 measurments of RPE. We then plot RPE as a function of the time interval at 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% quartiles. This RPE is computed as defined by  \cite{Sturm:2012}. Given a time interval $\Delta$, ground truth pose $Q\in SE(3)$, and estimated pose $P\in SE(3)$, at time step $i$ the RPE is computed as
\begin{equation}
	E_i = \left(Q_i^{-1}Q_{i+\Delta}\right)^{-1}\left(P_i^{-1}P_{i+\Delta}\right).
\end{equation}
Note that in our current implementation, RPE is computed without overlap. So, for example, if $\Delta=10$, then we compute RPE at 0, 10, 20, etc. In the future we should compute RPE with overlap. This code is currently in the $\texttt{perf\_eval}$ folder and is written in Matlab. When running the $\texttt{rpe\_main.m}$ script, one simply has to type the name of the ground truth and estimated pose files. The files must be moved into the $\texttt{perf\_eval}$ directory. Figure \ref{fig:exampleresult} show an example of the output of the performance evaluation script.
